## Probability Distributions:

&nbsp;

**1. Binomial distribution:** _How many times does_ X _occur (out of two possibilities) given_ N _trials?_

--

Conditions:

* fixed number of trials

* two possible outcomes

* unchanging probability

* trials are independent


&nbsp;


**2. Geometric distribution:** _How many trials need to occur before_ X _occurs?_

--

Conditions:

* unfixed number of trials

* two possible outcomes

* unchanging probability

* trials are independent


&nbsp;


**3. Poisson distribution:** _Given that_ X _occurs an average number of times in an interval of_ Y _length, what is the probability that it will occur a specific number of times in an interval of a different length?_

--

Conditions:

* number of times an event occurs over fixed unit of measure

* chance of occurance for event does not change

* trials are independent of each other


&nbsp;


**4. Exponential distribution:** _Given that_ X _occurs an average number of times in an interval of_ Y _length, what is the size of interval_ Y _that it would take to have a particular probability for_ X _to occur?_

--

Conditions:

* what interval length will likely give us a specified number of trials?

* chance of occurance for event does not change

* trials are independent of each other
