# Data Science Syllabus and Benchmarks
**Documented below are various tutorials, books, and online courses related to practical data science**

&nbsp;

**Background:** As of the beginning of this year (2019) this has undergone some serious revisions to reflect the things that I have read (and found useful), as well as things that I'm tentatively planning on reading and trying out before January is over. Rather than focus on a syllabus that overlaps with the content of a 12-week program I was considering, I decided to make this more reflective of what was currently mentioned on Lambda School's **30-week** syllabus at the time I was doing prework.

**Now that I know what syllabus sections tentatively correspond to what weeks of the course, I feel confident I can reorganize various sections of this markdown file to better reflect what *that* course covers.**

More than any other program, Lambda School's curriculum is focused on actually placing people in *jobs* - largely because [their main tuition model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGh5-g4KR1Q) only allows them to collect revenue when students have become gainfully employed.

## 1. Online Prep

These are sites with courses I have either already used or plan to use. I chose Codecademy and Datacamp because they take a more modular approach to how you learn a given topic - that is, you can stick to something specific rather than having to take an entire course track for the tidbits you actually need.

&nbsp;

#### A. Codecademy Courses: 

1. [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

2. [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)

3. [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)

4. [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)

5. [SQL: Analyzing Business Metrics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/sql-analyzing-business-metrics)

6. [SQL: Table Transformation](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/sql-table-transformation)

7. [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)

8. [Learn Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)

Learn the Command Line and Learn Git can be done in a day if I really wanted to. I might just repeat those from time to time. All the others on the list might take days to do, but Codecademy sometimes doesn't list hourly estimates. **At a bare minimum, you should do the first three (command line, git, SQL) since those cover things you can't as easily find elsewhere.** Basic Python for data science is covered well by Datacamp.

&nbsp;

#### B. Datacamp Courses:

1. [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

2. [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science)

3. [Importing Data in Python Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1)

4. [Importing Data in Python Part 2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-2)

5. [Introduction to Relational Databases in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-relational-databases-in-python)

6. [Interactice Data Visualization with Bokeh](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-data-visualization-with-bokeh)

7. [Statistical Thinking in Python Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1)

8. [Python Data Science Toolbox Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1)

Most of these take *four hours or less* to do according to the descriptions. I might try to do them all in one week. **The first two are excellent overviews of using Python in a data science context, absolutely make use of them.**

&nbsp;

#### C. Code Wars Challenges:

Based on the advice of a Galvanize student turned instructor, I should aim to surpass several levels of [python challenges on this site](https://www.codewars.com). I don't pretend to know how necessary that will be, but it wouldn't hurt to try to reach that level of proficiency.

&nbsp;

#### D. Kaggle Tutorials:

The homepage for these can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview

As of now, I'm not sure how useful the tutorials on that site will be given the fact that they appear to cover stuff I'll be learning elsewhere. But it won't hurt to see if there's anything I've missed. 

&nbsp;

## 2. Reading and Video Course List

In a matter of months, I should be prepared for the weekly content that someone would encounter in [Galvanize's 12-week Immersive](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/) course. I will be reading most of these titles through [Mapt.io](https://mapt.io/) since they tend to be published by Packt.

&nbsp;

#### A. Pre-Course Reading List

These are by no means the only books on my radar, there are plenty more for later but these are the ones I intend to have done before the course starts. Given that a project of mine involves the use of natural language processing to infer whether news articles or academic studies contain certain pieces of information or not, this list reflects that focus (in addition to touching on things Lambda covers).

  0. **Learn Python the Hard Way** - **250**, 52

  1. **Principles of Data Science** - **365**, 13
 
  2. **Data Science from Scratch** - **305**,	25
 
  3. **Humongous Book of Statistics Problems** - **525**, 18
 
  4. **Python Data Science Essentials 3rd Ed** - **450**, 8
 
  5. **SQL Practice Problems** - **140**, 57
 
  6. **Getting Started with Tensorflow** - **165**, 6
 
  7. **Statistics Done Wrong** - **130**, 12
 
  8. **Python Web Scraping Cookbook** - **330**, 11
 
  9. **Hands-On Automated Machine Learning** - **250**, 8
 
 10. **Hands-On Data Science and Python Machine Learning** - **395**, 10

 12. **Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics** - **280**, 15
 
&nbsp;

#### B. Pre-Course Video Tutorial List:

These courses come from Packt, they tend to reflect my focus on natural language processing. I've already noticed that it helps to learn the same subject matter in more than one format to really understand it. Below I listed how long the videos are, but **adding the actual time it takes to try out what they cover** usually means they take **three times as long to finish**.

  0. **Learn Python in Three Hours** - *3 hours*

  1. **Next Generation Natural Language Processing** - *2 hours*
  
  2. **Natural Language Processing with Python** - *2 hours*
  
  3. **Mastering Natural Language Processing with Python** - *2 hours*
  
  4. **Working with Big Data in Python** - *3 hours*
