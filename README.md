# Data Science Syllabus and Benchmarks
**Documented below are various articles, tutorials, books, videos, and online courses related to practical data science.**

&nbsp;

**Background:** In the fall of 2015, I attended [a free event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crowdfunding-decoded-find-your-early-adopters-and-launch-products-tickets-18339325416?aff=ebapi) at the Seattle Galvanize campus. The presentation itself was fascinating, but it also happened to be my first encounter with a coding bootcamp. Previously I heard of such things through stories about how regulations in California [were potentially stifling them](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140130/11104326050/apparently-you-cant-teach-someone-to-code-california-without-license.shtml), but I had no idea how effective they would become as a college alternative...

I already had plans on taking some courses from Udacity (particularly the [Data Analyst track](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), among [other things](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)), and Codecademy had already turned out to be a useful resource as well. So I decided to give coding bootcamps a shot as a more efficient way of both acquiring industry-relevant skills, as well as signal to potential employers what I am capable of doing.

In the spring of 2016, I attended a part-time data science course at General Assembly. I literally learned more in ten weeks from that course than I did *in general* from 18 months of being enrolled at a community college. My capstone from that course [can be found here](https://github.com/analyticascent/stylext). For over a year now I have anticipated taking the three-month immersive at Galvanize as a final stepping stone to full time work. But any endeavor this intense warrants some early training beforehand.

This is my attempt at putting that training syllabus together.

## 0. Online Prep

These are sites with courses I have either already used or plan to use. I chose Codecademy and Datacamp because they take a more modular approach to how you learn a given topic - that is, you can stick to something specific rather than having to take an entire course track for the tidbits you actually need. **I also hope to do at least one tutorial a day from either [Data Science Central](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/) or [KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/), in addition to a [Project Euler challenge](https://projecteuler.net/).** But before anything, I intend to start with [this set of python resources](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/python-resources) in addition to [this Ipython notebook](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/Learn-Data-Science-wk2/blob/master/Learn-Data-Science-wk2/datascience_meetup2.ipynb) that Galvanize has put on github. Those will serve as *week zero* of this entire process.

&nbsp;

#### A. Life is Study:

Somehow when doing a web search for information related to Ipython or Pandas or something along those lines, I came across [this blog series](http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/12/python-for-data-analysis-index.html). As anyone can tell just from the index alone, that series has a very good overview of some fundamental concepts. Not only that, but some of the specific techniques differ enough from the General Assembly Ipython lessons to make it work doing them all.

30. [Random Forests](http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/12/python-for-data-analysis-part-30-random.html)

Realistically, I think a section a day is a sensible goal. The more sophisticated sections will likely be things I repeat until I can code them from scratch (assuming I have a list of the procedural steps I need code for). This is the same approach I intend to take when reviewing my General Assembly lessons.

&nbsp;

#### B. General Assembly:

I should say early on that this is a course I already took. I just want to review the lessons again and fork each of the Ipython notebooks into different use cases.

1. Introduction to Data Science

2. Research design and Pandas

3. Statistics fundamentals

4. Command Line and Version Control

5. Fetching Data

6. Intro to Regression

7. Intro to Classification - K nearest neighbor

8. Evaluating Model Fit

9. Classifying with Logistic Regression

10. Advanced model evaluation

11. Standardization and Clustering

12. Natural Language Processing

13. Dimensionality reduction

14. Decision Trees

15. Ensembling, Bagging and Random Forests

16. Modeling with Time Series Data I

17. Modeling with Time Series Data II

18. Where to go next + bonus topics

19. SVC - Support Vector Classifier

20. Naive Bayes Classifier

21. Intro to Neural Networks

Each lesson has slides, and an Ipython notebook (or two) to go over. **One of the biggest mistakes I made during the [part-time course](https://ga.co/ds) was that I got in the habit of just executing the existing lesson code during class without actually taking the time to understand line-by-line what it was there for.** This time I plan on understanding everything line by line and making my own variants that include additional markdown documentation about what you should know about each of the python cells. Additionally, I plan on getting familiar enough with the procedural steps the notebooks take to the point where I can code them from scratch.

&nbsp;

#### C. Datacamp Courses:

1. [Introduction to R](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

2. [Intro to Statistics with R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-statistics-with-r-introduction)

3. [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

4. [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science)

5. [Importing Data in Python Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1)

6. [Importing Data in Python Part 2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-2)

7. [Introduction to Relational Databases in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-relational-databases-in-python)

8. [Interactice Data Visualization with Bokeh](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-data-visualization-with-bokeh)

9. [Statistical Thinking in Python Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1)

10. [Python Data Science Toolbox Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1)

Most of these take *four hours or less* to do according to the descriptions. I might try to do them all in one week.

&nbsp;

#### D. Codecademy Courses:

1. [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

2. [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)

3. [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)

4. [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)

5. [SQL: Analyzing Business Metrics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/sql-analyzing-business-metrics)

6. [SQL: Table Transformation](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/sql-table-transformation)

7. [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)

8. [Learn Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)

Learn the Command Line and Learn Git can be done in a day if I really wanted to. I might just repeat those from time to time. All the others on the list might take days to do, but Codecademy no longer lists hourly estimates. 

&nbsp;

#### E. Data Science Primer:

This is the recommended prep material that Galvanize recommends for their [data science immersive](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/) course: https://github.com/zipfian/data-science-primer

I intend to go over the review material listed to check for familiarity. If I don't feel proficient, then I plan to go over the rest in any given section. But one thing in particular I plan on doing is going over the Standford Machine Learning course (from Coursera) that they include in that repo. I doubt that will take more than a couple weeks if I go over it *after* doing all the sections above.

As mentioned above, Galvanize also has a great [python for data science](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/python-resources) primer repository, and they also have an [interesting practice scenario](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/Learn-Data-Science-wk2/blob/master/Learn-Data-Science-wk2/datascience_meetup2.ipynb) with Boston housing prices. Depending on how far I am with material in the reading section below, I could easily be ready to do a technical interview for an immersive course.

&nbsp;

#### F. Code Wars Challenges:

Based on the advice of a Galvanize student turned instructor, I should aim to surpass several levels of [python challenges on this site](https://www.codewars.com). I don't pretend to know how necessary that will be, but it wouldn't hurt to try to reach that level of proficiency.

&nbsp;

#### G. Project Euler:

For many people in the computer science community, [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net) is an amazing source of practice problems. Already the first few have turned out to be a great "procedual thinking" scenarios. They can be done in a variety of languages but obviously python will be my pick. **I think attempting (in python) the first 100 problems listed (~1/day) is a reasonable start.**

&nbsp;

#### H. Kaggle Tutorials:

Kaggle has a good [practice tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to experiment with. By the time I do everything else listed above, working with those should be an easy thing to do in an Ipthon notebook. Below are some of the datasets I want to work with:

* [Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
* [Credit card fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud)
* [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset)
* [Kickstarter Projects](https://www.kaggle.com/socathie/kickstarter-project-statistics)
* [Seattle AirBNB](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)

&nbsp;

## 1. Reading List

In a matter of months, I should be prepared for the weekly content that someone would encounter in [Galvanize's 12-week Immersive](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/) course. I will be reading most of these titles through [Mapt.io](https://mapt.io/) since they tend to be published by Packt.
